			<p>unlike in demon souls you now dont need to worry about conserving your healths as now you have a certain ammount of flasks and when you run out of them you can get them refiled by resting at a bonfire, as the game goes on you can aquire more flasks.</p>
			<p>dark souls has items that you can find that can give you a certain buff for a period of time such as maybe giving you a resistence to lightning etc.</p>
			<p>in this game you can find bonfires around the world these are resting points where you can refil your flasks or level up but when you rest at a bonfire all enemies come back except for bosses and mini bosses</p>
			<p>this game has a type of currency called souls these are gotten by killing enemies and used for buying things and leveling up but when you die you drop all your souls and if you dont get to them in time and die before you do then you lose your souls</p>
